## Introduction

As a part of obtaining my [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics), I have completed this capstone project.

In order to complete the case study, I followed the steps of the data analysis:

-   Ask

-   Prepare

-   Process

-   Analyze

-   Share

-   Act

The tools I used include the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) and the [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

## Scenario

You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

The director of marketing's goal is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. The team is interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.
